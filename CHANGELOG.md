# (Unreleased; add upcoming change notes here)

  of a notebook are open simultaneously. Note that as part of this
  work, iodide will no longer save in (unsupported) standalone mode.
  We may add this back at a future date.

  or session expiry, and offer to recover (fixes #1680)

  `html5lib`, `pygments`, `beautifulsoup4`, `soupseive`, `docutils`, `bleach`
- disable automatic saving and interactivity if viewing an out of
  date copy of the notebook (#1593)
- use maintained `markdown-it-katex` package
